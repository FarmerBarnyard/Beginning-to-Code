    <p>Bread pudding is a classic dessert made by layering or mixing stale bread with a custard made of milk, eggs, sugar, 
       and flavorings like vanilla, cinnamon, or nutmeg. The mixture is then baked until the custard sets and the top becomes golden brown. 
       It's often served with a sweet sauce, such as vanilla sauce or caramel sauce. The result is a comforting, warm, and delicious dessert that makes great use of leftover bread. 
       It's popular in many cuisines around the world and can be enjoyed in various forms, from simple homestyle recipes to more elaborate versions with 
       added fruits, nuts, or chocolate.</p>
