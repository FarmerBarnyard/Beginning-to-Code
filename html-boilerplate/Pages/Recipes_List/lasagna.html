    <h1> <strong> <em>  Classic Lasagna </em> </strong> </h1>
    <img src="lasagna_image.jpg" alt="Lasagna"> 
        <p> Homemade lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, rich tomato sauce, creamy b√©chamel sauce, and a mixture of cheese,
            typically mozzarella, ricotta, and parmesan. In between the layers of pasta and sauce, you can add various ingredients like ground beef or sausage, vegetables 
            such as spinach or mushrooms, creating a hearty and flavorful dish. The lasagna is then baked in the oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the pasta is 
            cooked to perfection. It's a comforting and satisfying meal that's perfect for gatherings or family dinners. </p>
    <h1> <strong> Ingredients </strong></h1>

        <h3> <strong> White Sauce </strong> </h3>
        <p> The white sauce, or Bechamel is equally as easy, you'll need: </p>

                <li> Butter </li>
                <li> Flour </li>
                <li> Milk </li>
                <li> Cheese </li>
            </ul>
        <p> The final component is the pasta, but you can garnish with a variety of different things but the essentials are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Lasagna Sheets</li>
                <li> Cheese (Lots of it) </li>
            </ul>

    <h1><strong> Method </strong></h1>
    <p> The method for Lasagna is relatively simple, We will start with the Meat Saauce, or Bolognese: </p>
        <ol>
            <li> Cook sliced onions and minced garlic together until onion is fragrant and transparent. </li>
            <li> Cook mince over medium heat until browned and cooked through </li>
            <li> Add diced tomato, tomato paste and any desired seasonings, leave to simmer over low heat until you are ready to use it</li>
        </ol>
    <p> Whilst that is simmering, we will make the white sauce: </p>
        <ol> 
            <li> Being by making a Roux, melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat, add flour and mix thoroughly. </li>
            <li> Slowly add milk, stirring constantly to avoid scorching the milk. </li>
            <li> When the milk has begun to warm, mix in cheese. </li>
            <li> If you find your white sauce is not thick enough, mix in some cornflour to thicken, remember to stir constantly to avoid clumps.</li>
        </ol>
    <p> To assemble, its a simple as layering the different layers; meat, pasta, and white sauce then cooking for 30-45 minutes until pasta is cooked through and cheese is melted.</p>
    <p> Some tips for when making your lasagna: </p>
        <ul> 
            <li> Add some meat sauce below the first layer of pasta (on the base of whatever tray you're using) to prevent the pasta from slipping </li>
            <li> you can add Chorizo or Chilli to add a little bit of spice to your lasagna. </li>
            <li> Substitude the beef mince for chicken or pork mince to add some lean meat to your lasagna. </li>
        </ul>
