    <body>
        <h1> Stylising Text Types </h1>
            <p>  To separate paragraphs the "p" function must be used </p>
            <p> When you want to type something in <strong> bold, </strong> the strong function must be used</p>
            <p> To <em> italicise </em> something, the em function must be used</p>
            <p> For extra headings, h1-h6 can be used for different levels of headings</p>

        <h1>Creating Lists</h1>
            <p> To create an unordered list, for groceries or similar type lists, use the ul function.</p> 
                <p>For example: <ul> </p>
                    <li> Item 1 </li>
                    <li> Item 2 </li>
                    <li> Item 3 </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p> If you wanted an ordered list, however, like a series of tasks, use the ol function.
                <p> For example: <ol> </p>
                    <li> Item 1 </li>
                    <li> Item 2 </li>
                    <li> Item 3 </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

        <h1>Creating Links</h1>
            <p> To hyperlink to another webpage or interior page, use the "a" command. For example; if we wanted to visit the Odin Project... </p>
                <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Click Here for The Odin Project </a>
            <p> If we wanted to link to another webpage, there is no need for the full url to be pasted, but it would work something like this...</p>
                <a href="pages/about.html"> About </a>
            <p> If the interior page is contained within another directory, then there must also be the directory included with the url, e.g Pages/about.html</p>

        <h1> Displaying Images </h1>
            <p> To place an image into a webpage it is a simple as using the "img" command </p>
            <img src="placeholder.gif" alt="Placeholder" height="310" width="310">

        <h1> Putting it all together</h1>
            <p> Here we combined all that was learnt above to create another subpage, which I have called <a href="pages/recipes.html"> Recipes </a> </p>
            <p> For some of my favourise recipes, I have included some quick links below: <ul></p>
                <Li> <a href="pages/Recipes List/lasagna.html"> Lasagna </a></Li>
                <li> <a href="Pages/Recipes List/Nachos.html"> Nachos </a></li>
    </body>
